title: "Decided to Move My Blog to Posterous"

Seems like I have a hard time being motivated enough to write anything down. There is definitely some overhead in writing my own blog, which is why I moved away from my custom Django blog. From there I have tried a bunch of static site generators powered by git/github (like nanoc, jekyll and webgen). I think switching to a tool that I donâ€™t have to maintain and has features like mobile compatibility or email posting might tip me over the edge.
